### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

  Lab 1 was my first experience in coding and how to work with linux. Which basically started my whole coding journey and paved the footsteps 
        to what I know now. I found out that coding with different code langauges can be fun and usefull. 
  
* Lab 3 

  Lab 3 was one of the labs which I liked most because of the introduction of testing code after using variables. I also learned how to initialization and worked with
        input and output functions. Which is a usafull concpt to grasp fue to the fact it lays tye foundations for coding. 
  
* Lab 5
  
  Lastly Lab 5 was my favorite lab due to the introduction of unit test and system test. This was a very helpfull way that guided me through code and or what i did wrong. 
            This allowed me to focus more on getting the code and good as possible and to test it as much as you can.
