### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

  Lab 1 which basically started my whole coding journey and paved the footsteps to what I know now. 
  
* Lab 3 

  Lab 3 was one of the labs which I liked most because of the introduction of testing code after using variables and initialization and input and output functions. 
  
* Lab 5
  
  Lastly Lab 5 was my favorite lab due to the introduction of unit test and system test that helped guide me through code.
